Built my own Weather Forecast Mobile Application using flutter and openweathermap API which holds information for current weather, future forecast and historical weather information for a particular location.

It has an interactive UI design helping the user understand the weather by animation representation of the weather & it helped me in basic understanding of App development.

Currently the app shows the current weather of a place on a device using its GPS location using  geolocator package of flutter. It can also help user if he wants to find whether of a particular place.


TODO :--
-> Deployment of app on play store. 
-> Adding more features such as weather forecast, air pollution index.
-> Pushing weather alert notification.
